# Optimising R for data analysis in ecology

https://github.com/Rstats-courses/cursoR-AEET-2019

Universitat de Girona, Girona, 25-29 March 2019.

Taught by [Ignasi Bartomeus](https://bartomeuslab.com/) & [Francisco Rodríguez-Sánchez](http://bit.ly/frod_san).


## Summary
 
R language and statistical software has become dominant to analyse data in ecology and many other scientific disciplines. This is a medium-advanced level course where we will work along different facets of programming in R language as well as relatively complex but very common statistical analyses in ecology (generalised models, mixed models, and multivariate analyses) and data visualisation.
 
The course will be eminently practical where students will ‘learn by doing’. We will learn advanced R programming (e.g. writing functions, vectorisation, simulation, reproducible computing) while analysing and visualising data. We will work through the different statistical analyses focusing on understanding and promoting good practice.
 
The course will be most useful to people who already use R for their data analyses but want to advance their skills to harness the full potential of R and their ecological data.

The course is aimed at postgraduate (M.Sc. or Ph.D.) students, postdocs, lecturers and researchers with some basic statistical knowledge and already familiar with R who want to get deeper into using R for data analysis in ecology. The student should be capable to interpret simple linear and generalised models (e.g. logistic regression), and be familiar with R (import data, data manipulation, basic data visualisation, fit simple models like lm or glm).

## Preparations

All students must bring their own laptop with the following software installed:

- **Last R version** (3.5.1)

- **Last version** of [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) 

- Updated R packages mentioned [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rstats-courses/cursoR-AEET-2018/master/pkgs2install.R). Probably it is easiest to just run `source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rstats-courses/cursoR-AEET-2018/master/pkgs2install.R")` from your local R to update/install all packages.

- Git: follow directions [here](http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html)

- Sign up on GitHub: https://github.com/join


## Course materials 

All course materials (slides, scripts, datasets, etc) will be available at https://github.com/Rstats-courses/cursoR-AEET-2019.
